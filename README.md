One of the most powerful ways to use R is to recognize when it is not the best tool for the job, but instead use it to interface with software better suited to a particular job. One tool that is very powerful for doing Bayesian analysis is Stan. While some Bayesian MCMC can be done in R, it is much more efficient to have Stan do the heavy computations, but use R to prepare the data and explore the results. This presentation will introduce some of the packages available that interface between R and Stan to help harness the power of both.
